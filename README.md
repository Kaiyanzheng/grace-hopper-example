For an OS repo, you need to set up security, create a roadmap for users to follow, etc.

## Daily Stand-Up:
- Review OSS issues or PRs opened in the last working day, so we do not miss anything.
- Review owned issues, maybe reassign or disown.
- Review open PRs, so we agree that it should be done or do not forget about them.

# Maintainence

    - Deal with old/abandoned PRs
