# Maintenance

### Daily Stand-Up Meeting:
- Necessary to regularly review new issues/PRs
    - Review OSS issues or PRs opened in the last working day, so we do not miss anything.
    - Review owned issues, maybe reassign or disown.
    - Review open PRs, so we agree that it should be done or do not forget about them.
